## Project Description

An interactive storytelling game that offers players a choice-driven narrative experience, allowing them to shape their character's journey. Within the game, players can also engage in various mini-games, including clicking pop-ups, memory challenges, and puzzles. Additionally, there's a combat system that enables the character to face challenges during their epic quest, that would use a turn based system.
